\# Stock Portfolio Tracker



A simple command-line tool to track the total value of a stock portfolio based on manually entered holdings and a predefined price list.



\## Goal



The project's goal is to build a basic stock tracker that takes user input for stock tickers and quantities, calculates the total investment value, and provides an option to save the portfolio summary to a file.



\## Features



\*   \*\*User Input:\*\* Interactively prompts the user to add stocks to their portfolio.

\*   \*\*Hardcoded Prices:\*\* Uses a Python dictionary for a fixed list of stock prices.

\*   \*\*Total Value Calculation:\*\* Computes the total value of the portfolio.

\*   \*\*File Export:\*\* Optionally saves the portfolio details to a `.txt` or `.csv` file.

1\.  Make sure you have Python installed.

2\.  Clone or download the repository.

3\.  Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

4\.  Run the script with the following command:

&nbsp;   ```

5\.  Follow the prompts to enter stock tickers and quantities. Type `done` when you are finished.
